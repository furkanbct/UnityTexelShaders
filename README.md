# UnityTexelShaders
URP Texel Lighting

Based on *com.unity.render-pipelines.universal@7.3.1* package / Lit shader

Actual texel calculation shader math belongs to https://forum.unity.com/members/greatestbear.1727336/

Inspired by this Unity forum thread: https://forum.unity.com/threads/the-quest-for-efficient-per-texel-lighting.529948/


**DO NOT USE TERRAIN SHADER! DUE TO UNITY HANDLING TERRAIN CONTROL TEXTUES, HEAVY NORMAL\ALBEDO MISMATCH. CURRENTLY WIP. TERRAIN SHADER MAY BE EXCLUDED FROM PACKAGE LATER**
